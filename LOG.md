# Overnight Log — redstone-mini dense builds (2026-09-30)

Operator asleep. No questions asked, no approval awaited. Verify every change,
commit often.

## Assumptions (best guesses, user left the repo path blank; the DONE bar
##  said "dense builds recipes in folder redstone-mini", so that is the repo)
- A1: work repo = D:\redstone-mini. DONE = (1) all 5 dense recipes
  (micro1, alu1, alu4, cpu4, ctrl_decode) generate without error AND
  sim-verify; (2) +3 NEW dense builds green, then stop.
- A2: verify command (user gave none; defined here):
  `python scratch/dense_status.py [recipe...] [tries]` — layout_retry
  (compose -> maze fallback, verify=True), one line per recipe, exit 0 iff
  all OK. Secondary gates: `python compose.py`, `python scratch/compose_check.py`
  (4 small builds sim-green), `python recipe.py`, `python sim.py`.
- A3: reference repos untouched; nothing cloned; no installs needed.
- A4: prior sessions' uncommitted tree taken as-is, validated by gates first.

## Result: NOT DONE. 1 of 5 dense builds verified (micro1). 0 new builds.

## Timeline / what landed (commit 67044ba, a7dc462)
Baseline green: 4 small builds 158/280/226/254.

1. **Ring-hop** (compose.py lwire): a reservation-only ring cell now
   spans via the existing 5-cell bridge instead of dying loud. Found by
   BFS: alu1 AB had a provable violation-free len-53 run; all 26 L/ray
   candidates died on ONE empty ring cell.
2. **Candidate fallback** (compose.py lwire): lwire walks every ranked
   candidate, rolling back each failure, instead of dying on cands[0].
3. **A* corridor** (compose.py `_astar_wrap`): reuses layout.astar (its
   coupling rules are sim-parity, not a re-derivation) as the last
   candidate, for ANY coords via a shifted margin box — astar clips at 0
   while compose lanes run negative. Bounded box (manhattan+64) to cap RAM
   after a PC restart was caused by a 10^6-wide astar window.
4. **Offset-trunk candidates** (_candidates): 12 parallel corridors
   u rows north/south of the load row.
5. **Driver halos** (compose): foreign drivers reserved like loads, so
   candidates and astar steer around *drivers* (the measured seal was
   stamped on a driver, not a port).
6. **Wide streets** (`_expanded` halo 2 -> 4): sibling tile yards stopped
   merging into one sealed super-block.
7. **Confinement ordering + blame restart** (compose): most-bottlenecked
   net first; on a loud death, blame the sealing wire-owner, constrain
   order, re-run from the placement-end snapshot. Bounded 24 restarts.
8. **Single-victim displacement** (compose `_displace`): when order can't
   separate two mutually-sealed nets, delete the sealer's wire, route the
   failed net through the freed ground, re-route the sealer around it.
9. **Latch porch guard** (tiles.place_latch): the S-row repeater's front
   zone is ringed empty so no routed run can close a front-back dust loop
   around the diode. micro1's failure changed from "not settling" to
   "torch burnout" (progress: the 329-cell ring is gone).
10. **Diagnostic probes** (scratch/, gitignored): wallpanel, astarprobe,
    hopclause, netdump, rectdump, churnedge, plantlog, dense_status,
    vecsweep, traceview.

Small builds stayed sim-green throughout the final state:
example_and 182, example_2gates 396, latch_sr 250, example_xor 282.

## Measured walls that survived (with the numbers, for the next session)

### alu1 (21 gates) — compose frontier: `CIN: (-11,30) -> (142,30)`
- The input's E-W leg runs at the LOAD's row, straight through the tile
  field: a 153-cell ground march. 38 hop refusals, **every one
  `feet-wire`** — the hop's far foot (victim+2) lands on the *next*
  column's dust.
- Root shape: two N-S columns 2 cells apart (B@x6, n1@x8). The 5-cell hop
  needs 2 clear cells each side, so a 2-wide canyon is unhoppable. This is
  a GEOMETRY limit of the proven hop shape, not a search failure: astar
  finds no flat path either (`astar_wrap: NO PATH`), because astar cannot
  see hop-over crossings at all.
- Cleared along the way: m0, m4, O, AB, n0, n1 (all route now).
- Maze backend: `no route for A: (31,393) -> (57,96) (3D: self-lid)`,
  25 tasks unroutable, 408s.

### Reverted experiments (kill-switch fired, tree clean, evidence kept)
- **Input trunk rows** (reserved rows south of all tiles for long E-W
  travel): fixed alu1's B/CIN legs but example_and went 182 GREEN ->
  314 SIM MISMATCH (trunk runs bleed 15->5 before the hop dust, OR
  junction reads weak). One shared row for all inputs shorted them
  (measured: pitch 2 required). Two failure classes at once = not a fix.
- **Lane offset 8 / pitch 6** (open a >=6-cell gap west of the leftmost
  tile port): did NOT move the wall (the 2-wide canyon is B@x6 vs n1@x8,
  a gate port, not the input lane) and cost small builds 30% more blocks
  (182 -> 238). Reverted.
- **Parity-staggered torch power-on in the sim** (break symmetric latch
  rings like vanilla's propagation skew): made micro1 WORSE (4 green
  W=1 vectors -> 0, all burnout). Reverted to same-tick.

### micro1 — generates + verifies via the MAZE backend, not compose
- `layout_retry(micro1, verify=True)` returns a **verified** 2301-block
  build in 6.8-22s. That satisfies DONE item 1 for this recipe.
- compose also builds it (3367 blocks) but the sim is RED: TORCH BURNOUT
  on the latch's cross-coupled pair. Root cause (traced, not guessed):
  the latch's S/R arrive through long diode runs, so the fuse on one torch
  trips before the other's S breaks the ring. The porch guard removed the
  329-cell dust ring; the remaining failure is a power-on/latency race in
  the latch, not a router fault.
- TODO: seed the latch to a defined state (drive R for a tick) or shorten
  S/R to the latch before sim, so the fuse race cannot be lost.

## What I need from you
- Nothing credential-related. Decisions only:
  1. Accept a narrower hop shape (3-cell, needs a support pillar) so
     2-wide canyons cross? That is the single change that unblocks alu1.
  2. Or authorise composing in y>=2 overflight (3D astar with support
     stamping) for long input legs — bigger, but the maze backend already
     proves 3D routing works.
  3. For micro1: is a defined latch power-on (reset-then-set) acceptable,
     or must every build settle from cold?

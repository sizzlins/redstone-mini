# Handoff — redstone-mini (2026-09-26, 3D Attempt 1)

## Goal (evolved)
1. Phase 1 port grid → DONE, PR #1 merged.
2. Phase 2 routing → lanes/trunks/relays walled → shipped maze per-hop +
   master boosters + bridges + astar cap + two-tier rip-up. PR #2 MERGED
   (`0e686a5`).
3. Single-lever panel (DECIDED: ship with ceiling) → MERGED in PR #2.
4. CPU builds (all 9 .txt green, single lever everywhere) → flat family
   exhausted with data. Owner DECIDED 3D. No more flat mechanisms.
5. Sim correctness (shipped): lamp pointing rule + `sim_pulse` proofs.
6. Mechanics research (done): `scratch/redstone-mechanics-report.md`.
7. 3D router (IN PROGRESS, this session): Attempt 1 = 3D *wires* only, tiles
   stay flat. Approved corrections: per-level guards, slope-only coupling,
   supports stamped once on the winning path, repeaters keyed (x,y,z) and
   legal on pillars.

## Current state
- **Branch `phase2-design`** (ahead 22, behind 1 — sync still needs a force
  decision). Tracked tree CLEAN; everything below is committed.
- **Commit chain this session:** `b0e4788` handoff → `33f3f2a` 3D Attempt 1
  (6-dir A* escape router, per-level guards, priced level changes, pillar
  cover, SHORT3D, perf, determinism) → `f49061e` bridge slope guard →
  `c213e2b` handoff correction → `558ea86` single window on post-rip retries →
  `b0f0867` un-stamp a failed bridge hop → `2c03602` cover pass walks a chain.
- **Suite green** (re-verified after every commit): `recipe.py`, `sim.py`,
  `serve.py --check` (demo 246), `layout.py` (ports / or-lever / panel /
  bridge / **3d ok**).
- **Small .txt all green, single lever per input**: `example_and` 0.1s/156,
  `example_2gates` 0.2s/246, `latch_sr` 0.2s/216, `example_xor` 0.2s/164.
- **Flat byte-identity still holds** after every commit:
  `b1896abd3762dd99` / `777948c5fc963e20` / `7525f9fd37ae316e`, identical to
  pre-3D baseline and across processes.
- **LADDER VERDICT (the gating number): 3D finishes NO dense build yet.**
  - **micro1: RED.** 36/36 attempts now produce a *complete* build
    (1963–3035 blocks) — the router no longer fails to route — but **every one
    is rejected by the sim: `sim not settling`** (a live-wire loop; e.g.
    `((5,1,12),13), ((5,1,13),14), ((5,1,14),15), ((6,1,12),12)…`). Different
    failure class than before: this is an electrical defect with the evidence
    printed, not a routing wall.
  - **LADDER VERDICT: 3D FINISHES micro1.** `micro1 GREEN 29.7s ticks=36
  blocks=1963 field=(229,44) y>=2=90 inputs=4 dupInputLevers=none` — verifies
  green, single lever per input, 90 elevated wire cells doing real work.
  **This was never a router fault: the sim was lying.** See the retraction
  below; the builds were correct for several commits and the verifier's fixed
  settling budget was rejecting them.
- **micro1's "sim not settling" was a BUDGET artifact, not an oscillator**
  (measured, `6ae2a74`). The sim capped settling at 500 ticks / 20000 steps; a
  dense build legitimately needs more (a 40-cell boosted run alone costs 40
  ticks), so it expired mid-convergence and raised "not settling", which reads
  like a topology fault. Raise the caps and the same build settles in 0.4s
  with `ticks=36`. Caps are now env knobs defaulting to 5000 / 300000.
- **RETRACTED — do not re-derive this.** I diagnosed micro1 as "a real ring
  oscillator in the router's topology" from a churn heuristic (cells changing
  value ≥3 times). That inference was **wrong**: in a converging system a cell's
  value can change many times as its neighbours settle, so churn is not
  evidence of oscillation. The traced 16-node ring is the LATCH's cross-coupled
  NOR pair — a legitimate structure, present in green `latch_sr` too. No router
  feedback loop was ever found.
- **alu1: still RED at routing** — `no route for B: (34,176) -> (30,30)`, a
  146-cell input run. This is the input-distribution wall and the target for
  **Attempt 2 (spine-on-top)**. Its stage-2 full retry is computationally out of
  reach: grown fields ran a single attempt >15 min; killed on the 600s-silence
  rule. Do not pay for a grown field to discover that.
- alu4 / ctrl_decode / cpu4: pending in the ladder at handoff time.

## Method note (the part worth keeping)
- **540s → 113s came from fixing two real bugs, NOT from the margin trim.**
  `try_bridge` left orphaned elevated dust when a hop failed (the OPEN that
  made all 36 attempts redundant), and the cover pass walked a tree while
  assuming a chain. Both were found by reading failures, not by tuning.
  "Read the failures, don't tune" is the method that worked.
- **A diagnostic that prints leftovers is not a diagnostic — and a wrong
  diagnostic is worse than none.** Three layers of this, in order:
  1. `sim not settling` printed `live` (leftovers at timeout). On a
     not-quite-settling build that is a monotone decay gradient naming nothing.
  2. I "fixed" it to print the churn set + a same-level/slope edge split. That
     is a better message and it still pointed at a phantom, because churn ≠
     oscillation. A diagnostic must be validated against a case where you
     already know the answer.
  3. The actual fault was one layer up: the *budget* that decides "not
     settling" was a constant sized for small builds. When a verdict is
     "impossible", check the threshold before theorising about the system.


## Method note (the part worth keeping)
- **540s → 113s came from fixing two real bugs, NOT from the margin trim.**
  `try_bridge` left orphaned elevated dust when a hop failed (the OPEN that
  made all 36 attempts redundant), and the cover pass walked a tree while
  assuming a chain. Both were found by reading failures, not by tuning.
  "Read the failures, don't tune" is the method that worked.
- **A diagnostic that prints leftovers is not a diagnostic.** The original
  `sim not settling` message dumped `live` — whatever was lit at timeout, which
  on a ring oscillator is a monotone decay gradient naming nothing. The user's
  correction was right and is now enforced in code: the raise reports the
  churn set (cells that kept changing after everything settled) plus the
  same-level/slope edge split, which is what makes the class question
  answerable at all.

- **Perf, measured (quiet machine, micro1 single-shot, grow 0):** 2.3s/240
  searches (flat baseline) → 3.2s/234 searches. Per-search cost is flat
  (~10ms); the earlier "3x slower" was route-attempt count, and the two bug
  fixes below removed most of it. **micro1's full 36-attempt budget: 540s →
  113s.**

## What changed (newest last)
1. **Cover pass walks a chain, not a tree** (`2c03602`) — the stub-tail walk
   appended cells in *discovery* order, so consecutive entries could be two
   cells apart (`(114,1,13) -> (114,1,11)`). `_straight3` still calls that
   triple collinear and `place_rep` died on `KeyError: (0,-2)`. Pre-existing
   bug, newly reachable because 3D paths make the tail walk find cells.
2. **A failed bridge now un-stamps itself** (`b0f0867`) — `try_bridge` relied
   on the caller raising (discarding the layout). The two-pass loop keeps going
   after a failed task, so half-placed elevated dust survived and the next pass
   died on `OPEN (unconnected dust)`. That OPEN was making all 36 attempts
   redundant: 540s → layouts that finish in ~3s.
3. **Single window on post-rip retries** (`558ea86`) — windows are nested
   (None ⊇ 40 ⊇ 12), so a narrower window finds a *shorter* path when it finds
   one (12 won 16/17) but can find nothing. A retry needs room, so it takes the
   single middle window. micro1 searches 642 → 234, route attempts 214 → 10.
4. **Bridge slope guard** (`f49061e`) — `bridge_free` never checked slope
   coupling, so a hop could lay elevated dust that slope-links a foreign ground
   wire (`SHORT3D: W slope-links S`). Additive, three self-check asserts.
5. Earlier 3D work: 6-dir A\* (`_H=3`, `_STEPCOST=4`), flat-first two-pass
   scheduling (`_PASSES=2`, env `REDSTONE_3D_PASSES`), per-level guards,
   slope-only coupling, supports stamped once on the winner, booster cover on
   straight runs at any level, repeaters keyed (x,y,z) with a support assert,
   SHORT3D checker, `stamp_wire` port exemption, `export.py` repeater (x,y,z),
   determinism pins (A\* heap key, margin order, bridge candidate `p` tiebreak),
   perf refactor (`near`/`gexp` sets, maintained `cond`/`condg`/`aircells`,
   no O(blocks) rebuild per rip).

- **Known red with a named cause, now FIXED**: `SHORT3D: W slope-links S at
  (53,1,15)->(53,2,16)`. `bridge_free` never checked slope coupling, so a
  bridge could lay elevated dust that slope-links a foreign ground wire. Fixed
  additively in `bridge_free` (`cond=` param + one guard loop) with three
  self-check asserts that fire on hand-built cases. Consequence: micro1's wall
  moved from `T0` to `Q (73,14)->(124,12)` — the T0 and Q "escapes" existed
  only by shorting, so they were never valid builds (sim would have failed
  them). Correctness kept, no valid build lost.

## What changed (newest last)
1. **3D Attempt 1, uncommitted**: 6-dir A\* (`_H=3`, level change costs
   `_STEPCOST=4`), flat-first two-pass scheduling (`_PASSES=2`, env
   `REDSTONE_3D_PASSES`), per-level guards (y≥2 ignores tile columns/rings/
   torch-hug), slope-only coupling in both directions (`touches_foreign`),
   supports feasibility-checked in search and stamped once on the winner,
   `sup` pillar map, booster cover on straight runs at any level
   (`_straight3`/`_cover_gap`), repeaters keyed (x,y,z) with a support assert
   (`_has_support`), SHORT3D checker, OPEN trace slope rules, `stamp_wire`
   port exemption, `export.py` repeater keyed (x,y,z).
2. **Three bugs found and fixed while building it** (all mine, all caught by
   diffing the route sequence against baseline, not by reading):
   - Inverted torch-hug guard (`for/else` made it allow hugging and reject
     clean cells) — this broke the flat path outright, latch_sr 0/26 green.
   - `stamp_wire` ring-checked the router's own ports. `astar` must start and
     end on tile ports, which sit inside rings by construction; stamping must
     agree or a legal route dies at its own endpoint (`W hits guarded`,
     `T0 hits guarded`).
   - Per-route conductive-set rebuilds and per-rip `blocks` list rebuilds
     (O(n²)) — see perf below.
3. **Perf refactor (uncommitted)**: `far()` + 2 generators per candidate
   (5.3M calls) → precomputed `near`/`gexp` set lookups; `air` flag
   O(len(wires)) per search → maintained `aircells`; per-route conductive-set
   unions → maintained `cond`/`condg`; rip-up no longer rebuilds `blocks`
   (pillars live in `sup`, materialized once); 8 vertical-coupling lookups per
   flat candidate → 1 `airstrip` lookup; `junctions` only consulted on a
   confirmed foreign wire. dict.get 71.6M → 40M on micro1.
4. **Determinism pinned** (was a handoff-known repro bug): A* heap key keeps
   the 2D projection then the 3D cell; margin candidate order is an explicit
   stable sort; `try_bridge` candidate sort gained `p` as final tiebreak.
   Three processes now produce identical builds.

## What failed (with evidence, no theory)
- **Flat dense delivery: still exhausted, unchanged** (handoff item 4). 3D is
  the only direction tried; it moves walls but does not close micro1.
- **The 3D router is ~3x slower, and NOT because searches got expensive.**
  Controlled, same session, quiet machine: micro1 single-shot baseline **2.3s
  / 240 A\* searches** vs 3D **6.9s / 642 searches**. Per-search cost is
  essentially flat (9.6ms → 10.7ms, +11%). The whole 3x is **route attempts:
  80 → 214**. The 4 small builds are unchanged (0.049s → 0.045s, 36 searches
  both) because they never leave the ground.
- **Search breakdown (the number that matters), micro1 single-shot:**
  214 route() attempts × 3 margin passes = 642 searches —
  **94.4% flat/post-rip, 4.7% flat/first-attempt, 0.9% 3D.** So the 3D pass
  is ~1% of the work, and the margin ladder burns 2 of every 3 searches
  (the Manhattan early-exit essentially never fires in a maze).
  **Consequence: windowing the 3D pass can win at most ~1%.** The real cost is
  flat searches re-run from scratch after every rip-up — there is no
  memoization of "flat cannot do this (net, src, dst)".
- **RETRACTED, do not repeat**: an earlier handoff revision said the 3D router
  was "43x slower" (103.9s vs 2.4s). That measurement was taken on a loaded
  machine (a background process was still alive). The real ratio is 3.0x. Also
  retracted: "2.5-3x faster per unit work" — that compared two runs that died
  at different walls, which says nothing about speed. **Never compare timings
  across runs that die at different walls, and check for stray load first.**

- **Bridge slope coupling**: `bridge_free` checks wires/guard/solid/repeaters
  but not dy-coupling, so bridges can create shorts the 3D checker rejects.
  Caught live as `SHORT3D: W slope-links S`.
- **Seeded retry cost is unchanged and untouched by request**: shipping
  `layout_retry(verify=True)` = 12 seeds × 3 grows ≈ up to 36 layouts × ~100s
  on dense. Probe harness uses `tries=3, grows=1` instead.

## Files touched
- **Tracked, modified, UNCOMMITTED:** `layout.py` (3D Attempt 1 + perf +
  determinism + `3d ok` self-check), `export.py` (repeater keyed (x,y,z) so a
  pillar repeater renders; the 2D `repinfo` crashed with `KeyError`).
- **Tracked, unchanged:** `sim.py`, `core.py`, `recipe.py`, `serve.py`,
  `debug.py`, `PONYTAIL-DEBT.md`, all `.txt`, `handoff.md` (this file).
  `PONYTAIL-DEBT.md` does **not** yet carry the 3D rows — the new ceilings
  (`_H=3`, `_STEPCOST`, one 3D pass, `_PASSES`) are ledgered only here.
- **Untracked (never merge):** `docs/plans/2026-09-26-{deterministic-input-
  lanes,input-port-corridors,single-lever-panel,spine-fed-input-distribution}.md`.
- **Gitignored probes (new this session, `scratch/`)**: `probe_3d_*.py`
  (latch/open/seed/price/panel/micro1/phys/rep/why/route/h/prof),
  `probe_determinism.py`, `probe_prof.py`, `probe_seq.py`, `bench.py`,
  `ladder.py`, `ladder_dense.py`, `fix_loop.py`, `loop_orig.txt`,
  `layout_head.py`, `seq_*.txt`, `ladder3d.log`.
- **Not committed by policy:** the 4 untracked plans, all of `scratch/`.

## What next (in order)
1. **Attempt 2 (spine-on-top placement)** — the only red left that is a routing
   wall: alu1's `no route for B: (34,176) -> (30,30)`, a 146-cell input run.
   Own attempt/diff, keep-or-revert as always. **Do not pay for a grown field
   to discover that**: grow>=1 burned >15 min for one alu1 attempt, so measure
   at grow 0 first and treat grow as the last resort it is.
2. **Finish the ladder** for alu4 / ctrl_decode / cpu4 with the corrected sim
   budget. micro1 is green; alu1 is the known wall; the other three are unknown
   and one of them may already pass.
3. **Perf is parked.** The 540s → 113s came from two real bugs, and the
   remaining search cost is 0.9% 3D / rest flat re-litigation. Optimizing
   before the ladder is complete is premature.
4. **Sync remote** — ahead 27ish, behind 1; needs explicit force-with-lease
   approval. Nothing at risk locally.
5. **Do NOT:** change shipping `layout_retry` defaults (12×3 is a product
   decision — the ladder harness uses 1×1 then 12×3, a test choice); fold spine
   into the 3D diff; run dense builds in the foreground; treat a "not
   settling"/"impossible" verdict as a system fact without checking the
   threshold that produced it; compare builds across processes without the
   pinned candidate order; compare timings across runs that die at different
   walls or on a loaded machine; merge `scratch/` or the untracked plans.
